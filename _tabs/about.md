Hey there, welcome to my about page!

I'm Vivek, a computer science student and self-proclaimed tech nerd. When I'm not buried under a pile of code or textbooks, you can find me exploring the latest gadgets and gizmos or scrolling through tech forums trying to keep up with the latest trends.

Aside from being a tech enthusiast, I'm also an avid GitHub user. You can find me sharing my latest projects and ideas on my profile, [@ifsvivek](https://github.com/ifsvivek){:target="_blank"}. I take great pride in my repos, so feel free to check them out and let me know what you think!

If you want to get in touch with me, you can find me on Twitter at [@ifsvivek](https://twitter.com/ifsvivek){:target="_blank"}. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you have a great day!
